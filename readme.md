## No External Libreries
The original task is for React and advised to use as many libs as possible.
Here I were told to build **Native JS, without any external lib**
I did took though, an idea from [cli-spinners](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cli-spinners) and their UT8 char code

## No server at all
It wasn't a request, but why to create one if it is not needed?

## Some show off

### Nice architecture
Very modular and easy to use or modify

### Toggle
Very easy to use Toggle widget that created every `create-toggle` css class
**Example:**
```HTML
<div class="create-toggle" data-name="toggle-example" data-header="Some header" data-vals='{"val1": "yes", "val2": "sure"}'></div>
```

### I did all your bonuses :)
Luckly I could resist the temptation to work the dark theme for hours

### Nice caching & storage 
But it is too easy with `localStorage` I must edmit

### I used a generator function
I know it is not a real show-off but it is rearly used and it is kinda nice feature

### Design
Well, I design it all myself, did not use any external template! (I know it is not the much :( I tried my best though).
Check it out in your smart phone & desktop screen!

**Enjoy**
